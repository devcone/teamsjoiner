# teamsjoiner
A bot to join teams meetings when you're away, so you can be anywhere you like!


help is appreciated as i am new to c# (coded in c#)

PLEASE READ: most of the code was written from tutorialsEU on youtube, give him a sub if this helps! obviously i did a bit of editing to make it a teams joiner, but most of the credit should be his :)
