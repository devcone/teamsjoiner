A bot to join teams meetings when you're away, so you can be anywhere you like! designed to be user friendly and have a "plug and play" aspect, to run you need no knowledge of coding or any experience. And most importantly, only use this when you absolutely have to. Meetings and classes are necessary for learning and organisation.
